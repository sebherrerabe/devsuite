# Projects (Specs) — Agent Instructions

## Purpose

`projects/` is the spec system and execution plan for DevSuite. It is the source of truth for what gets built, in what order, and how work is decomposed.

## Conventions

- Follow `projects/_conventions.md` exactly for file formats and checklists.
- Update project status docs (`STATUS.md`) when progress/blockers change.
- Decompose work into vertical slices and assign to personas defined in `projects/_personas.md`.

## Where to start

- `projects/_index.md` for dependencies and priority order
- Each project's `PROJECT.md` for summary/success criteria
